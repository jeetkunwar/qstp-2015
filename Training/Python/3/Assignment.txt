Assignment

1. Go over the chapters 1-12, 21, 27 - 34.

2. Rename prog1.py to Week2_Assn_YOURNAME.py

3. Do the following
	3.1 Add more fields to the object student. Date of Birth, Year of Enrollment, Class Enrolled in,
		Section enrolled in. All dates should be stored in DDMMYYYY format and read directly from raw input.
		These fields should be asked during createStudent.
		
	3.2 Create a rollnumber during __init__ for the student based on the last 4 digits of the year enrolled and and the first two letters of 
		first and last name. So the roll number for Parthey Agrawal enrolled in 2014 would be PaAg14.
		
	3.2 Create a list called TeacherList and create a class called Teacher. Add the required fields to it.
		First Name, Last Name, Year Joined, DOB. Create a createTeacherList function as well.
		
	3.3 Create functions for searching by last name, Date of Birth for both Teachers and Students.
	
	3.4 Create a function called promoteStudent which takes in a student object as an input and increases his 
		class enrolled in by 1.
		
	3.5 Create a function called addStudent which adds a student to the studentList. Same for the teachers.
	
	3.6 Search a student by firstname using the function. Store this in a temp_student variable. Feed it to 
		promote student function.
		
4. This one is little tough.
	4.1 Create a function called searchByYearEnrolled. Now this function has to return a list. 
		It should ask for year enrolled, iterate over the studentList and match the year enrolled. 
		For every hit found it should add the student object to a temporary list. It should return the 
		list after the for loop is over.
