Problem 1.
Write a program that does the following in order:
1. Asks the user to enter his/her last name.
2. Asks the user to enter his/her first name.
3. Prints out the user’s first and last names in that order.

An example of an interaction with your program is shown below (the words with a single star
are from the computer, based on your commands, the words with a dollar are a user’s input –

$Enter your last name:
**Anmol
$Enter your first name:
**Sahoo
$Anmol
$Sahoo

(Yeah, I am a little self obssessed - Anmol)

l_name=raw_input("Enter your last name: ");
f_name=raw_input("Enter your first name: ");
