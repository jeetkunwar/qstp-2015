Cloning :
First we forked from your repository,
that is we created a copy of the original repo in our local repo. 
And then we cloned from our local repo to receive a local copy.

Commit :
Then we create a new file. We added(staged) it to our local copy by using the
git add * command. Then we made a commit to the changes we have made to the
file. This was done using the git commit -m "THE MESSAGE".

Push to remote :
Then we pushed the changes we have commited in the previous step to our 
local repo on github. This was done using the git push origin master command.
This means that we are pushing all our data to Origin from our master branch.


Pull from remote :
Then we added your repo as one of the remote repositories by the git remote add
command. And then finally we pull from your repo by git pull "name" master
command. So if any changes have been made to the original repo I can see that.
