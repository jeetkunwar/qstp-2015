Hey guys! Let's get started again, now that we have had our breaks. 

Step 1: Go to this site and complete this tutorial. http://www.sitepoint.com/build-to-do-list-30-minutes/
Pretty simple tutorial. You will easily follow through. Just one thing,
 don't change the database engine to SQL. Just skip that step and do 
everything before and after that. Once you are done with the tutorial, for the to-do list just update a few entries with your name and send me a screenshot. 

Step 2: For those of you, who finish by Wednesday 24 June 2015, go to 
http://www.tangowithdjango.com/book17/ and start from Chapter 4 and finish 
it by Friday. 


I'll upload the next assignment shortly. 

As ever, Call me if you need anything. :D
