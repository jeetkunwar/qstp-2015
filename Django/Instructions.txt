Now that you guys have installed DJango, time to get going! 

First thing, read about MVC Framework. That has to be the most important
thing that you have to understand properly.

Next up go to these tutorials and start reading. You don't have to
understand everything now, but make sure you get the basic understanding
of models and views.

The tutorials are - 

1. http://tutorial.djangogirls.org/en/index.html
This is a basic tutorial and it is very good fun. Recommended if you 
are a beginner. :D

2. http://www.tangowithdjango.com/book17/
A little more advanced. Suitable for you if you are confident you can 
handle statements like - "Django's ORM let's us define models without 
interfacing with the SQL, which helps us call the elements of the model
in our views in the form of Python classes and return the render request
to the appropriate function." :p

See you in the next hangout. :D
