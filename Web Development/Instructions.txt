Hey! For all those interedted in Web Development, please go through 
this pdf. It's important that you guys understand the how a website
is actually rendered.

Make sure you understand the tags properly. <p>, <h>, <b>, <img>.
So on. Just read them carefully, you don't have to do the exercises.

For the CSS part, just understand what CSS does, we will be using a CSS
template, because we don't have time to cover CSS in detail. But still
make sure you have a basic understanding of CSS.
